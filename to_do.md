#1 find out info about the data of agouti, deepsqueak (locations, when did they record, total observations per location) to summarise the data.

RUNTIME DONE, TOTAL OBSERVATIONS DONE, LOCATIONS DONE

#2 find when they recorded at the same day --> find out if they ran the same hours --> save the dates, hours they recorded at the same time as you only can use these recordings

DOOO
HOW:
AT THE MOMENT I ASSUME THAT THE LAST RECORDING OF DEEPSQUEAK FILE IS JUST A OBSERVATION AND THAT IS DOESN"T MEAN THE RECORDING ENDED THERE.

SO I ASSUME FOR DEEPSQUEAK THAT IF THAT DATE IS NAMED, IT RECORDED THE WHOLE DAY

see which date match and untill what time.

#3 find the files that contain data of those moments

#4 information about those recordings

#5 interval


#22 mei, verder met match_dates() , vindt nu mathcing dates, code netjes
