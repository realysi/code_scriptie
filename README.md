# Agouti.py
This file processes the data received by the agouti (neural network). The agouti software scans wildlifecamera images for sightings of animals, and labels these. It returns three csv files containing usable information: observations.csv, media.csv and deployments.csv. 

observations.csv contains: deploymentID, sequenceID, scientificName and to the second exact timestamp.
media.csv contains: sequenceID and fileName.
deployments.csv contains: deploymentID, longitude, latitude, locationName and cameraID.
